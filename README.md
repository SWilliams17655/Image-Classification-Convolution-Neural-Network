This program searches a dataset of images containing flowers and classifies those images as one of five flower types including a Lily, Lotus, Orchid, Sunflower, or Tulip. To accomplish this, the algorithm uses a convolution neural network to extract features. In a previous program we used a Densely Connected Neural Network to classify an image, but that system was susceptible to image orientation. In contrast, the neurons within a CNN have developed regional awareness by splitting the image into smaller segments. As shown in the figure below, the algorithm runs multiple kernels over that image similar to a sliding window with varying weights that extract features from the image i.e. corners, edges, etc. Shifting up a level, those kernels are analyzed by a higher-level kernel creating an assessment of the relationship between different features i.e. “there is a corner here and an edge next to it”. This is known as the feature extraction process. Once that is accomplished, the output is flattened and fed into a traditional dense neural network. 
 
During the final phase of processing the DNN is fed into an activation function which outputs a classification. There are many forms of CNN. During testing this CNN had an 80% accuracy with validation data as shown in the figure below.
